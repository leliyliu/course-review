# Philosophy of Science final_term review

## Popper
### Popper's theory of the scientific method
1.Science does not begin with "pure" observation,but with PROBLEMS
<br>2.Science begins with problems created by the disappointment of an expectation(anomalies(异常现象))
<br>3.The formulation of a new theory is never the outcome of pure observations, but it is an attempt to solve a certain problem, i.e. to slove a mystery

process:

    Problems -> Theories(proposed solutions) -> Criticism(empirical control)
    then move back to the problems 
### the problem of demarcation（科学的划界问题）

    1.distinguishing between scientific theories and 'non-scientific theories' 
    2.Fallibilism has an important consequence: if we want to increase and improve our knowledge, the only thing we can do is trying to criticize and falsify our theories
    3.observation is used to check the validity of the proposed theories.
    !!4.Scientific theories are scientific not because they can be verified, but because they are falsifiable.

all theories are hypothesis and they cannot be regarded as dogmas

if we want to increase and improve our knowledge, the only thing we can do is trying to criticize and falsify our theories.

the progress of science is based on the attempt to falsify our knowledge

### POPPER
 there is a difference between "logical falsification" and "methodological falsification"(Popper is not a naive falsificationism)
    
    1.this means that a fact which is contrary to a theory does not allow us to reject the theory immediately
    2.While falsification is always certain from a logical point of view, it is not absolutely certain from a methodological one 

## Duhem/Quine thesis
A theory cannot be conclusively falsified, because the possibility cannot be ruled out that some part of the complex test situation(protocals, auxiliary assumptions), other than the theory under test, is responsible for an erroneous prediction
Popper says:"In point of fact, no conclusive disproof of a theory can ever be produced."

Chalmers's criticize on Popper is wrong because he is not a naive falsificationist and he supports that all knowledge is fallible, including falsification.

## Thomas Khun
A key feature of Kuhn's theory is the emphasis placed on the revolutionary character of scientific progress.
<br>Another important feature of science is its sociological dimension

    1.!!The history of science is characterized by revolutions
    2.A revolution involves the abandonment of one theoretical structure(conceptual framework) and its replacement by another, incompatible one
    3.An important role is played by the sociological characteristics of scientific communities

a science progress can be summarised by the following scheme:

    Pre-science -> Normal science(a single paradigm becomes dominant) ->Crisis -> Revolution -> New normal science -> New cirsis 
 
 (paradigm is an important concept for Khun)


The existence of a (dominant) paradigm capable of supporting a normal science tradition is the characteristic that distinguishes science from non-science, according to Khun

Sociology lacks a paradigm and consequently cannot be regarded as science 

Kuhn portrays normal science as a puzzle-solving activity governed by the rules of a paradigm.

!!! A failure to solve a puzzle is seen as a failure of the scientist rather than as an inadequacy of the paradigm 

Puzzles that resist solution are seen as anomalies rather than as falsifications of a paradigm.(all paradigms will contain some anomalies)

    1.an annalysis of the characteristics of a crisis period in science demands the competence of the psychologist as much as that of the historian
    2.When anomalies come to be seen as posing serious problems for a paradigm, a period of "pronounced professional insercurity" sets in.
    3.When the proponents lose their confidennce in the paradigm, the time is ripe for revolution
    4.The seriousness of a crissis deepens when a rival paradigm makes its appearance

Proponents of rival paradigms are "living in different worlds"


!!!
The  adoption on the part of individual scientists of a new incompatible paradigm is linked by Kuhn to a "religious conversion"

!!! There will be no purely logical argument that demonstrates the superority of one paradigm over another(incompatible)


### Khun's Incommensurability

    1.Incommensurability is the idea that two paradigms can be so different as to render impossible any straightforward comparison of them with each other
    2.There is no common language in which both can be translated 
    3.As a consequence, it is impossible to say that a paradigm is better than another
    4.Later paradigms are not better than earlier, just different
    5.Truth is relative to a paradigm

but Popper: objective truth is possible, sociological relativism is mistaken
<br>the progress of science and techology shows that scientific theories are not mere opinions, but objective truth.

### Chalmers:Khun is ambivalent(矛盾的) about objectivity

this is inconsistent with Khun's Philosophy of science because of 3 reasons:
    
    1.For Khun what counts as a puzzle and a solution is paradigm-dependent 
    2.Khun elsewhere offers different criteria such as simplicity
    3.Even more problematic is the clash between the last part of that sentence (the non-relativist claim about progress ) and the numerous passages in Khun's book that look as an explicit advocacy of the relativist position, and even as a denial that there is a rational criterion of scientific progress at all(e.g. scientific revolution are gestalt（完全形态） switches or religious conversion)
